<h1> Personal Portfolio Website </h1>

<p> Created to showcase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities, this website serves as both a project 
for my portfolio, and as the portfolio itself. </p>

<p> Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I used Bootstrap and a number of JavaScript plugins to create it. </p>

<p> As of now, it is simply used as a showcase, but in the future it may be used to host a blog or something 
along those lines. </p>
